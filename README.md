# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator


App Description:

Ay you know there are multiple ways to generate secure random password based on user-selected criteria. In this password generation web application I adopted the approach of programmer called Dont's Repeat Yourself/DRY method. So, I tried Javascript for functionalities and used minimal JS code for instance used String.formCharCode to Convert a set of Unicode values into characters: https://net-comber.com/charset.html 
This random strong password generator app UI is fully responsive on all screen devices viewports by using flex box model, bootstrap, css media queries. This application is mainly built in html, css and javascript. After all this app will generate randome secure password for user the way they want to protect their sensitive data from non stakeholder. 
This application consists of 8 main components. Means, generate button, the result area, minimum and maximum length of password, includes uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, symbols and finally to copy password to clipboard. 
There is a generate button once Clicked will generate a secure passord for user. The generated password will be displayed in a result container area for user. 
User can choose and include special character, symboles, numbers, upperCase letters and lowerCase lettes as usually the pre-requisite of a secure password and Javascript will render the result as desired.
Also, there are checkboxes to checked or un checked to include or exclude some characters for instance numeric and symbols etc. To cap it all, the app UI looks elegant and the password generator works to generate a strong password for users.
